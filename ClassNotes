This is the notes about HashMap:
=================================
In the Map we have to insert the data as key value pair and they are tightly coupled. There is no key without pair and so. 
Duplicated keys are not allowed but values are allowed. 

In map Entry means a pair of key and value, A map is a collection of entries
There are 2 classes to implement Map interface, Hashmap and HashTable
Hashmap-> Underlying datastructure is hashtable
          Insertion is not preserved(which our classes that inherit hashing techniques doesnot preserver insertion order)
          Null key is allowed only once 
          Searching is very faster in Map
          Let's see the methods present in the HashMap
          
 Map Methods:
 
      1) put method help us to insert one key value pair
      2)m.putAll-> Helps us to insert one full map to another Map
      3)m.get(key)-> It will provide the value against the key
      4)m.remove(key)-> Here we can remove the value along with the key  	
      5)m.contains(key)-> It will return true or false if there is a key present
      6)m.contains(value)->it will return true or false if the value is present
      7)m.isEmpty() Checks wether the Map contains anything
      8)m.size() -> Number of Entries
      9)m.clear() -> Clear the Map
       
  ======================================================
  Methods related to Entries, these method will work with key and value
  
 -> I want to retrieve all the keys from the map then we have to use
      m.keySet() ->All the list of keys will be returned. Return type is set(Keys cannot contains duplicate)
      m.values() ->returns all the values (return values will be collection type since it allows duplicates)  
      m.entrySet() 101 Delson, 102 Denya (All the entries indivdually and the return type of this method is Map.Entry
      
  ==========================================================================
  
  Entry Interface -> Sub interface of Entry interface. 
  
     These methods are applicable to the EntrySet. First we need to retrieve on Entry and we can apply the following method to that
    1)e.getKey() -> Provide the values against the key
    2)e.getValue()    
    3)e.setValue(Object ) if we need to change the value against key we can use this.
